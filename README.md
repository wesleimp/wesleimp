### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm Weslei! I'm a software engineer based in Blumenau - ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·.

Iâ€™m a follower of Jesus, a husband, an open-source lover and passionate about music, technology and aviation, not necessarily in that order.

Currently I have been working with Elixir, although I have also worked with Go and C#.
